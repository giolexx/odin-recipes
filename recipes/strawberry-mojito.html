        This strawberry mojito recipe makes the perfect drink for a hot summer day!
         I had this drink at a popular chain restaurant and decided to try it at home.

   <p class="description">     I have served it at several different gatherings,
          and it has always been given rave reviews.

    <ol class="orlist">
        <li> Pour about 1/2 inch of sugar onto a small, shallow plate. Run a lime wedge around the rims of 8 cocktail glasses, then dip the rims into sugar to coat; set aside.</li>
        <li> Squeeze all of the lime wedges into a sturdy glass pitcher. Toss juiced limes into the pitcher along with mint, strawberries, and 1 cup sugar. Crush with a muddler to release strawberry juice and mint oil. Stir in club soda and rum until sugar has dissolved.</li>
        <li> Pour into the prepared glasses over ice cubes to serve. </li>
